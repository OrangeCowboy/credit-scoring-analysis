# credit-scoring-analysis
This project explores credit risk assessment using real-world credit card default data. The goal is to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of default, using MySQL for data storage, Python for Analysis and PowerBI for visualisation. The project follows best practices to demonstrate an end-to-end financial DS workflow.
